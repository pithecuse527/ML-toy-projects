# IMPORTANT
1. Please give '-lm' flag when you compile the .c file in gcc on linux. (i.e. gcc assignment2.c -lm -o assignment2)
2. There was no problem on Mac OS without the '-lm' flag

# Notes
1. Input file name must be defined at FILE_OPEN (#define) and only with the name (i.e. if the file name is "test.txt", give "test")
2. Output file name will be FILE_OPEN+"_sol" (i.e. if the input file is test.txt then the output is test_sol.txt)
3. You can also use Rand. range [1 ~ 25] but the function will use the given file by default
4. Use the randomly choosed initial centroids
5. Example files -> test2.txt and test_sol2.txt
